Since our founding in 2015 in Pune, we have been pioneers—among the first to offer Big Data Analytics and Data Science training in the region. By 2017, we kicked off our CSR skill-training initiatives and signed memoranda of understanding with several prestigious academic institutions. In 2020, we swiftly expanded our reach by launching virtual, instructor-led training programs. In 2023, we were honored with the title of “Best Institute for Data and Analytics Training in India.” Most recently, in 2024, we crossed ambitious milestones: delivering 50+ corporate batches, 100+ university programs, and training over 1,000,000 students.
Our reach spans across top-tier organizations such as HDFC, Capgemini, Deloitte, Happiest Minds, NPCI, NRL Assam, Amdocs, WNS, and Mindgate—all testament to our credibility and expertise.
We’ve also made an impact in academic collaborations. We signed industry partnership agreements (MoUs) with institutions like ISBM College, JSIMR (Jayawantrao Sawant Institute of Management & Research), and MIT‑ADT University, where we conducted practical workshops on Generative AI, prompt engineering, and healthcare analytics. One notable example is our recent Data Analytics for Healthcare course, held in February 2025 with the University of Mumbai’s Gahlot Institute of Pharmacy, which combined real-world case studies with ethical AI practices 
Furthermore, our trainers have led hands-on workshops at corporate clients like ZS Associates, covering Python for data analysis and AI topics such as Transformers and Pandas . We also guided students at DY Patil College through immersive PowerBI sessions 
These success stories illustrate our commitment to excellence, practical learning, and the strong, lasting partnerships we build across industries and academia.
