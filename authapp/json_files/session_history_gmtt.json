This approach ensures the highest survival rate and maximum environmental impact.\n\nIf you have a preference for a particular tree species, please feel free to let us know. We will do our best to accommodate your request while ensuring the chosen species is appropriate for the planting location.\n\nWould you like to know more about our tree maintenance process or the benefits of donating trees with us?"
